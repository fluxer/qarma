qarma
=====

Qarma is a tool to create dialog boxes, based on Qt.
It's a clone of Zenity which was written for GTK+.


Q: Why do you waste time cloning a perfectly fine tool?

A:
"The answer is that GTK+ is primarily intended to be used on the GNOME desktop"
"GTK+ must focus on being the toolkit of the GNOME platform first, and tackle integration second."

Q: Does the name mean anything?
A: Yes.
